<h2>hello you, welcome!</h2>

Hey there, I'm Moss, a Software Engineer living in Berlin. I work from home since 2019 and I am so passionate about working remotely that I am an Engineering Team Leader at [Remote](https://remote.com). 

I like many things but what I like the most is fixing things, cuddling with my wife and pets, listening to music, studying, and 3D printing. That's a lot, right? But apart from cuddling with my wife and pets, I am not doing all of them every day and often. Like most of the people, my hobbies are seasonal.

If you'd like to know more about me or have feedback on my website, please reach out. Let's connect and share our thoughts!
